# **Research Project Guidelines**

A research project (paper and presentation) will count as 40% of your final grade. Students are expected to work in groups of *three to four*. One grade will be given per group, unless there are extenuating circumstances in which different grades should be given to individuals within a group. This must be discussed with the instructor.

The research project should focus on the development and/or use of a computational model in an area of student interest (e.g., microeconomics, international relations, environmental policy, social hierarchy, economic development, historical dynamics, finance).

The research paper should cover four main themes:

1) a description of the model;
1) systematic experimentation with the model;
1) presentation of model results, and
1) a summary of the model’s capabilities and what was achieved with it.

An initial presentation of your project proposal and progress to date will be made during class in Week 11 (*November 3rd and 5th)*. The final project will be presented during the final exam period on *December 10th*. All project materials are due Monday *December 14th* by the end of the day.. Please submit all materials on Blackboard. **Late submissions will not be accepted without prior approval by the instructor and may receive a penalty(one quarter of a letter grade per 24 hours).**

The final paper should be a minimum of 3000 words and no more than 5000 words (including citations). Papers under or over these limits will lose one quarter of a letter grade per 500 words.

*General guidelines:*

- This a CSS course: your project needs to contain both computation and social science elements.
- Your project must utilize and be relevant to material discussed in the class.
- Programming is not required (though encouraged), but fiddling with some kind of model is required
- Meet with your groups early
- Propose a lean project with little liabilities

*Guidelines for Paper:*

The paper is expected to be of similar style to that of a research paper (including the appropriate referencing style and good use of English). That is, it should have the following sections, or be similarly organized:

**Abstract**

Summarizing the paper

**Introduction**

Discussing the purpose of the model, i.e., what is the model “for”; not what is the model “of”

**Background**

Describing prior work has been carried out in your area of research

**Methodology**

Describing the model (i.e. How did you go about building the model)

**Results**

Systematic experimenting with the model and presenting of model results.

**Summary/conclusion**

**References**

All papers, models[^1], web links, etc. cited in the main text, using a consistent reference style. (Could be a good time to learn Zotero or another reference manager)

In addition to the paper, the model code (in electronic format along with auxiliary material) is also expected so I can run the model when grading the paper.

*Guidelines for Presentations:*

Your presentation on November 3rd or 5th should be no more than 5-7 minutes. It should introduce your group, describe the key issue(s) you are addressing in your project, briefly indicate the model you plan to develop and/or use for your analysis, and give some idea of your progress to date. The use of Powerpoint or a similar presentation software is not necessary, but if you will be using a slide deck, please provide a copy to the instructor prior to the class in case of technical difficulties. You should be prepared to answer questions  and elicit suggestions at the end of your presentation (approximately 5 minutes will be allocated for this after the presentation).

Your presentation on December 10th should be no longer than 15 minutes. It should take the form of a formal conference/work presentation. The use of Powerpoint or a similar presentation software is not necessary, but if you will be using a slide deck, please provide a copy to the instructor prior to the class in case of technical difficulties and as part of your final project. You should also be prepared to answer questions of clarification during your presentation and other questions at the end of your presentation (approximately 5 minutes will be allocated for questions after the presentation).

*Guidelines for Additional Material*

In addition to the paper and presentation, you may also create a web page with animations, model demo, etc. if you like. See, for example, the McBride page on his ZI Trading model (<http://www.memcbride.net/models/2014/7/11/zi-trading>). Ideally this would be done inside Blackboard. Please discuss this with the instructor beforehand.

**Metrics for grading the paper:**


Once again, the key dates for this project are:

- **Monday or Wednesday November 3rd or 5th in class** - presentation of project proposal and progress to date
- **Thursday, December 10th in class** – presentation of final project
- **Monday, December 14th by the end of the day** – all final project material (including paper, model code, data) is due
