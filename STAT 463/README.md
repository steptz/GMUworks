In this folder, you find the 3 data sets you used for completing assignment 5 B- they can be potentially combined, or you can use just one of them (use either, two or all three of them depending on the graph you are planning to create). Data are from USA facts about Covid-19 county case and death count as well as state populations. 

Feel free to dig into these data and create an improved graph compared to what you completed for assignment 5B. Please remember, you cannot submit the same graph you submitted for assignment 5B.
